# Derivation of asthma severity from electronic prescription records using British Thoracic Society treatment steps

Welcome!  In this project I used Scottish asthma prescription records from PIS (the Prescribing Information System) to estimate a patient's severity, by proxy of their joint British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) treatment steps.  

A conference paper entitled ["Estimation of Asthma Severity from Electronic Prescription Records using British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Treatment Steps"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9669455) from the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) 2021 is available online.

The primary paper relating to this body of work was published in BMC Pulmonary Medicine on November 3rd, 2022, and is available [here](https://trebuchet.public.springernature.app/get_content/d1832c74-117c-414b-9bfb-3c7668e8d98c).

## Paper Abstract
Asthma severity is typically assessed through a retrospective assessment of the treatment required to control symptoms and to prevent exacerbations. The joint British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) guidelines encourage a stepwise approach to pharmacotherapy, and as such, current
treatment step can be considered as a severity categorisation proxy. Briefly, the steps for adults can be summarised as: no controller therapy (Step 0), low-strength Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS; Step 1), ICS plus Long-Acting Beta-2 Agonist (LABA; Step 2), medium-dose ICS+LABA (Step 3), and finally either an increase in strength or additional therapies (Step 4). This study aimed to investigate how BTS/SIGN Steps can be estimated from across a large cohort using electronic prescription records, and to describe the incidence of each BTS/SIGN Step in a general population.

There were 41,433,707 prescriptions, for 671,304 individuals, in the Asthma Learning Health System Scottish cohort, between 1/2009 and 3/2017. Days on which an individual had a prescription for at least one asthma controller (preventer) medication were labelled prescription events. A rule-based algorithm was developed for
extracting the strength and volume of medication instructed to be taken daily from free-text data fields. Asthma treatment regimens were categorised by the combination of medications prescribed in the 120 days preceding any prescription event and categorised into BTS/SIGN treatment steps.

Almost 4.5 million ALHS prescriptions were for asthma controllers. 26% of prescription events had no inhaled corticosteroid prescriptions in the preceding 120 days (Step 0), 16% were assigned to BTS/SIGN Step 1, 7% to Step 2, 21% to Step 3, and 30% to Step 4. The median days spent on a treatment step before a step-down in
treatment was 297 days, whereas a step-up only took a median of 134 days.

We developed a reproducible methodology enabling researchers to estimate BTS/SIGN asthma treatment steps in population health studies, providing valuable insights into population and patient-specific trajectories, towards improving the management of asthma.
