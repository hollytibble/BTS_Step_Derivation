# BTS_Step_Derivation

Welcome!  In this project I am reporting the identification and processing of asthma medication prescription records for the estimation of British Thoracic Society treatment steps.  The scripts, written in the R language, will be made available upon the publication of the primary analysis paper.  

Thank you for visiting,
